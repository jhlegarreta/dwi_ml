    """This neighborhood definition lies on a sphere. Returns a list of 6
    positions (up, down, left, right, behind, in front) at exactly `radius`
    length. Good for RNN, for example.
    If radius is an iterable of floats, returns a multi-radius neighborhood.

    Hint: If you know your radius in mm only, use
    dwi_ml.data.processing.space.convert_world_to_vox.convert_world_to_vox
    Ex: radius_vox = convert_mm2vox(radius_mm, affine_mm_to_vox)

    Note: We only support isometric voxels! Adding isometry would also require
    remembering where the x,y,z directions are.

    Parameters
    ----------
    radius : number (int or float) or list or np.ndarray.
        Distance to each neighbor on a sphere (in voxel space).

    Returns
    -------
    neighborhood : np.ndarray[float]
        A list of vectors with last dimension = 3 (x,y,z coordinate for each
        neighbour per respect to the origin). Hint: You can now interpolate
        your DWI data in each direction around your point of interest to get
        your neighbourhood.

    Parameters
    ----------
