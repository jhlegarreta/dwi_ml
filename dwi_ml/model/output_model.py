DESCRIPTION = """
MODELS:
    REGRESSION models: Simple regression to learn directly a direction (each 
    output size = 3 = [x,y,z]). This means that it is a deterministic output.
        - CosineRegressionOutput: Model: a 2-layer NN
                                  Loss: Cosine similarity
        - L2RegressionOutput: Model: 2 Linear layers
                              Loss: Pairwise distance
                              
    CLASSIFICATION models: That means that the output is a probability over all
    classes. We can decide how to sample the final direction. The classes depend 
    on the model.
        - SphereClassificationOutput: Model: a 2-layer NN *                                       
                                      Classes: 100 discrete points on the sphere
                                      (dipy.data.get_sphere('symmetric724'))
                                      Loss: Negative log-likelyhood

    GAUSSIAN models: Contrary to regression, who would learn the parameters 
    (hidden through the weights) that would represent a function h such that
    y ~ h(x)  (we learn the *parameters*), gaussian processes learn directly 
    the *function probability*. See for ex here
    https://blog.dominodatalab.com/fitting-gaussian-process-models-python/
    The model learns to represent the mean and variance of all the functions 
    that could represent the data. 
        - SingleGaussianOutput: Model: a 2-layer NN for the mean and a 2-layer 
                                NN for the variance.*
                                Loss: Negative log-likelihood
        - GaussianMixtureOutput: Model: (a 2-layer NN for the mean and a 2-layer 
                                 NN for the variance.) for each of N Gaussians.*                  
                                 Loss: Negative log-likelihood.

    FISHER VON MISES models: This model provides probabilistic outputs using the
    Fisher - von Mises distribution, which resembles a gaussian on the sphere. 
    As such, it does not require unit normalization when sampling, and should be
    more stable while training.                                                                                          # toDo. Can we have a bit more (easy) explanation?

* p.s. Torch kind of does a softmax after although it is not explicit.

INPUTS:  Def: Here, we call 'input' the output of your experiment model. Ex, RNN.
         Type: torch.tensor
         Size:
             - Sequence models: [batch_size*seq_len, nb_features]
              where seq_len is the nb of time steps in the sequence.
              So the input sequences are concatenated.
             - Local models: [batch_size, nb_features]

OUTPUTS: Def: The model final outputs.
         Type: torch.tensor
         Size: 
             - Sequence model: [batch_size*seq_len, 3]
             - Local models: [batch_size, 3]

TARGETS: Def: The target values (real Y) for the batch
         Type: Could be `PackedSequence.data`
         Size: 
             - Sequence models: [batch_size*seq_len, 3]
